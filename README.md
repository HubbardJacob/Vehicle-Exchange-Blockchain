# Vehicle-Exchange-Blockchain
Created to practice Golang and to further my understanding of blockchain technology. Transactions involve vehicle (vehicles have a unique VIN number). Can verify the owner/past owners of a vehicle, full transparency on a vehicle's past history. Any data regarding a vehicle can be stored.
